# ucsd-bioinf-labs
A database containing comprehensive information about faculty and labs in the UCSD Bioinformatics Graduate Program

## The Problem
UCSD's Bioinformatics program includes several dozen faculty members. The brief characterizations of them on the program's faculty page are inadequate and their websites are often out of date. This makes it difficult to get a clear picture of what faculty do and how they are related without interviewing them directly. For new students, choosing the right rotations and finding a lab with available funding is an unnecessarily daunting and laborious task.

## First Aim
Collect a list of salient features that can be used to characterize faculty and labs. Special focus on things that are important to new students who are choosing rotation advisors and joining labs.

## Second Aim
Populate a database with information on faculty and their salient features, perhaps in .json format. Collect electronic submissions from students and interview faculty.

## Third Aim
Wrap collected data with an intuitive and useful graphical interface.
